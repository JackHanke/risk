# An exact formula for RISK combat

In the board game RISK, a number of attackers $a$ can attack an adjacent country of defending force $b$ using the following process. A thorough preliminary treatment of the subject was done by the author of the [DataGenetics](http://datagenetics.com/blog/november22011/index.html) blog. 

In this project I show the RISK recurrence relation, as well as a generating function and an exact (though complicated) formula for the probability of success for the attacking side.
