# An exact formula for RISK combat

In the board game RISK, combat occurs between two countries of attacking force a$ and defending force $b$. The rules of combat and empirical work on the probability an attacking force $a$ wins can be found on the [DataGenetics](http://datagenetics.com/blog/november22011/index.html) blog. 

In this project I show the RISK recurrence relation, which is satisfied for all $a\geq1,b\geq0$. This project uses this relation to construct a generating function and an exact (though complicated) formula for the probability of success for the attacking side. A (incomplete) writeup is found at `writeup/risk.pdf`. 

It is important to note that this formula was created solely as an academic exercise. The recurrence relation is sufficient for fast computation of the probability.
